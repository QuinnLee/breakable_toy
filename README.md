World-traveller
=============
App found at http://world-traveller.herokuapp.com

The app is a teaching tool.  All the UNESCO Heritages sites are loaded and displayed.
Users can record their travel logs, with valid dates, and make plans.  
Each plan is unique and can hold various locations.  

The map displays the everything about the user, as well as, polylines between the various
logs and plans.  

There is also a feature to reccomend places the user visits.

Features That I am Working on:
+ Distance measurement
+ Social aspect e.g. sharing plans
+ using WIKI for more data
+ Gamification
+ Using PostGIS 
+ Expanding the DB
+ Creating an ember or angular front-end
